          <h2><a href="#" rel="bookmark">How do rovers communicate with Earth?</a></h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>Mars rovers communicate with Earth using radio signals transmitted through NASA's Deep Space Network.</li>
          <li>Signals can also be relayed through orbiters circling Mars for faster data transfer.</li>
          <li>Due to the distance, signals take between 4 and 24 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Rover lifespans vary greatly depending on design and conditions.</li>
          <li>Spirit and Opportunity were designed for 90 days but lasted years longer.</li>
          <li>Curiosity has been operating for over 10 years and is still active today.</li>

          <h2><a href="#" rel="bookmark">What powers the Mars rovers?</a></h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>Earlier rovers (Spirit, Opportunity) used solar panels for power.</li>
          <li>Curiosity and Perseverance use nuclear power (radioisotope thermoelectric generators).</li>
          <li>Nuclear power allows rovers to operate through dust storms and at night.</li>

  <section id="hero" class="container">
    <h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif; color: #D96B43; text-align: center;">More Questions</h2>
    
    <h3 style="font-family: Georgia, serif; color: #8C3C2A;">How fast do Mars rovers travel?</h3>
    <p>Mars rovers move very slowly compared to vehicles on Earth. Curiosity's top speed is about 0.09 mph (140 meters per hour). This slow pace helps protect the rover from damage and allows for careful navigation over rocky terrain.</p>
    
    <h3 style="font-family: Georgia, serif; color: #8C3C2A;">Can rovers be controlled in real-time?</h3>
    <p>No, because of the communication delay between Earth and Mars (4-24 minutes), rovers cannot be controlled in real-time like a remote-control car. Instead, scientists send detailed instructions that the rover follows autonomously.</p>
    
    <h3 style="font-family: Georgia, serif; color: #8C3C2A;">Have rovers found life on Mars?</h3>
    <p>No definitive evidence of life has been found yet. However, rovers have discovered that Mars once had liquid water and conditions that could have supported microbial life. The search continues with Perseverance actively collecting samples.</p>

          <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Perseverance rover carries a small piece of Martian meteorite that fell to Earth thousands of years ago. This makes it the first Mars sample to return to its home planet, even if only briefly before being used for calibration purposes.</p>
