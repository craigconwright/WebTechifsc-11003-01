                        <h3>How long does it take to get to Mars?</h3>
                        <p>The journey to Mars typically takes between 6 to 9 months, depending on the positions of Earth and Mars in their orbits. The distance between the two planets varies from about 34 million miles (at closest approach) to over 250 million miles (at farthest).</p>

                        <h3>How do rovers communicate with Earth?</h3>
                        <p>Rovers communicate with Earth using radio waves through NASA's Deep Space Network. They can send signals directly to Earth or relay them through Mars orbiters like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It takes between 5 to 20 minutes for a signal to travel from Mars to Earth, depending on their distance.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What powers the Mars rovers?</h3>
                        <p>Different rovers use different power sources. Earlier rovers like Spirit and Opportunity used solar panels to generate electricity. Newer rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance use nuclear power from radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which convert heat from radioactive decay into electricity. This allows them to operate regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How fast do Mars rovers travel?</h3>
                        <p>Mars rovers move very slowly for safety reasons. Curiosity and Perseverance have a top speed of about 0.1 mph (0.16 km/h), and typically travel around 660 feet (200 meters) per day. The slow speed allows the rover to carefully navigate obstacles and avoid hazards.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is the temperature on Mars?</h3>
                        <p>Mars is much colder than Earth. Average temperatures are around -81°F (-63°C), but can range from -195°F (-125°C) near the poles in winter to 70°F (20°C) at the equator during summer days. The thin atmosphere means temperatures can vary dramatically between day and night.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Have we found signs of life on Mars?</h3>
                        <p>We have not found definitive proof of past or present life on Mars. However, rovers have discovered evidence that Mars once had liquid water and conditions that could have supported microbial life. The search continues, with Perseverance collecting samples that may eventually be returned to Earth for detailed analysis.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do scientists control the rovers?</h3>
                        <p>Due to the communication delay, rovers cannot be controlled in real-time like a remote control car. Instead, scientists and engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory send a sequence of commands each day. The rover executes these commands autonomously, using its onboard computers and hazard-avoidance systems to navigate safely.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why is Mars red?</h3>
                        <p>Mars appears red because its surface is covered in iron oxide, commonly known as rust. Over billions of years, iron in the Martian soil oxidized (combined with oxygen), creating the distinctive reddish color we see from Earth.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is a "sol"?</h3>
                        <p>A "sol" is a Martian day. One sol is slightly longer than an Earth day, lasting 24 hours and 39 minutes. Mars rover missions count time in sols rather than Earth days. For example, Opportunity operated for 5,352 sols (about 5,498 Earth days).</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much did the Mars rovers cost?</h3>
                        <p>Mission costs vary significantly. The Mars Exploration Rover mission (Spirit and Opportunity) cost about $400 million each. The Curiosity mission cost approximately $2.5 billion including development, launch, and operations. The Perseverance mission cost about $2.7 billion.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can the rovers find fossils?</h3>
                        <p>While rovers have instruments to detect organic molecules and biosignatures, finding actual fossils would be extremely difficult. Most rover instruments analyze the chemical composition of rocks rather than looking for macroscopic fossils. However, Perseverance is collecting samples that will hopefully be returned to Earth, where scientists could examine them for any signs of ancient life, including possible microfossils.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Will humans ever go to Mars?</h3>
                        <p>NASA and other space agencies are actively working toward sending humans to Mars, possibly in the 2030s or 2040s. Mars rovers are helping pave the way by testing technologies, identifying resources like water ice, and studying the Martian environment to help prepare for human exploration.</p>
