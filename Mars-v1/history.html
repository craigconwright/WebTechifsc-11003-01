      <h3>Mission Details</h3>

      <article class="mission-detail">
        <h4>Perseverance (2021–Present)</h4>
        <img src="assets/img/perseverance.jpg" alt="Perseverance rover on Mars surface" class="float-right">
        <p><strong>Mission Goal:</strong> Search for signs of ancient microbial life and collect rock samples for future return to Earth.</p>
        <p><strong>Landing Site:</strong> Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide basin that was once flooded with water and home to an ancient river delta.</p>
        <p><strong>Major Accomplishments:</strong> Perseverance carries the MOXIE experiment, which successfully produced oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. It also deployed Ingenuity, the first helicopter to achieve powered flight on another planet. The rover has collected dozens of rock samples that could one day be returned to Earth.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Instruments:</strong> Mastcam-Z cameras, SuperCam laser, PIXL X-ray spectrometer, SHERLOC ultraviolet spectrometer, and MEDA weather station.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="mission-detail">
        <h4>Curiosity (2012–Present)</h4>
        <img src="assets/img/curiosity.jpg" alt="Curiosity rover self-portrait on Mars" class="float-right">
        <p><strong>Mission Goal:</strong> Investigate whether Gale Crater ever had environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.</p>
        <p><strong>Landing Site:</strong> Gale Crater, a 96-mile-wide impact crater with a mountain (Mount Sharp) rising from its center.</p>
        <p><strong>Major Accomplishments:</strong> Curiosity confirmed that ancient Mars had the chemical ingredients and energy sources that life requires. It found organic molecules in Martian rocks and detected seasonal methane variations in the atmosphere. After more than a decade, it continues climbing Mount Sharp and making new discoveries.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Instruments:</strong> ChemCam laser, SAM chemistry lab, CheMin mineral analyzer, RAD radiation detector, and REMS environmental sensors.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="mission-detail">
        <h4>Spirit &amp; Opportunity (2004–2010/2018)</h4>
        <img src="assets/img/spirit.jpg" alt="Spirit rover artistic representation" class="float-right">
        <p><strong>Mission Goal:</strong> Search for and characterize rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars.</p>
        <p><strong>Landing Sites:</strong> Spirit landed in Gusev Crater; Opportunity landed in Meridiani Planum, on the opposite side of Mars.</p>
        <p><strong>Major Accomplishments:</strong> Both rovers found strong evidence that liquid water once existed on Mars. Opportunity discovered hematite "blueberries" (iron-rich spheres formed in water) and ancient sedimentary rocks. Spirit found evidence of hot springs and volcanic activity. Opportunity holds the off-Earth driving record at 28.06 miles.</p>
        <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Originally designed for 90-day missions, Spirit operated for 6 years and Opportunity for nearly 15 years—a testament to their remarkable engineering.</p>
